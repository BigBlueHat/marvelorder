overview: >-
  A nice exploration of the samurai-ninja aspect of the story, including its
  roots in the actual Marvel comic books. There are the requisite interviews
  with the principal cast and crew along with copious clips from the film as
  well as some behind the scenes footage (including a look at that supercool
  metallic bed that the elderly Yashida lies on in the lab in his fortress).
