title: 'Thor: Tales of Asgard'
slug: thor-tales-of-asgard
description: >-
  Hungry for adventure, Thor secretly embarks on the journey of a lifetime,
  joined by his loyal brother Loki, whose budding sorcery equips him with just
  enough magic to conjure up trouble, along with the Warriors Three - a band of
  boastful travelers reluctant to set sail on any adventure that might actually
  be dangerous. But what starts out as a harmless treasure hunt quickly turns
  deadly, and Thor must now prove himself worthy of the destiny he covets by
  saving Asgard itself.
