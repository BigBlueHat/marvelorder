And despite his perseverance and longing for the truth, he remains an enigma to himself and those around him.

The series is story edited by showrunner Christopher Yost, who also worked on Wolverine and the X-Men, and numerous other Marvel Animation projects.

It is the first Iron Man television series since Iron Man from 1994–1996, and started airing after the success of the live action Iron Man film.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of teenage child prodigy Tony Stark and his alter ego of Iron Man. As Iron Man, he uses his technological inventions to fight various similarly technologically advanced threats. His friends, James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes and Pepper Potts help him on his courageous, and dangerous adventures.",
