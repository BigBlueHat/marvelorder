  Thor goes on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced — a quest for inner
  peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr
  the God Butcher, who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat,
  Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Korg, and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster,
  who — to Thor’s surprise — inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as
  the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to
  uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s
  too late.
