It isn't long before their attempt to return to normal is upended by a brutal attack from a new unknown enemy, and Peter, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.",
