K'uk'ulkan led some guards up to the land where he saw a civilization. They attacked the civilization to make room for his mother's burial.

He returned from there distressed and began construction of his vault in his mansion.",

She also remembers this as the earliest memory of when she gained her powers that allow her to shoot photon blasts out of her fists. Vers now trains with Yon-Rogg, aiming to become a member of Starforce. Although Yon-Rogg believes she is ready, the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree Empire, figures otherwise but nonetheless allows Vers on the team, which consists of Minn-Erva, Korath, Bron-Char, and Att-Lass. Yon-Rogg gives the Starforce a briefing, to rescue a Kree operative named Soh-Larr. Yon-Rogg informs the team that Soh-Larr has been captured on the planet Torfa. Yon-Rogg instructs the team to perform an incursion on the planet, so Vers and the rest of the Starforce land underwater and used their suits to reach the surface. Soon they encountered Torfans who turned out to be Skrulls, getting ambushed by the Skrull leader Talos and his subordinates. Vers finds Soh-Larr, but realize he has been compromised by Talos, who kidnaps her to a Skrull spacecraft, while the rest of the Starforce retreat. On the spacecraft, Talos gains access to Vers' memories from various points in her life. Vers awakens just as Talos unlocks her memories, revealing that he wants information from her pertaining to a Light-Speed Engine. She orchestrates an escape, with Talos, Norex and two other Skrulls in pursuit, crash-landing to Planet C-53 or it's other name Earth.",

While Talos and the Skrulls assume the role of surfers on a beach the next day, Vers crashes through the roof of a Blockbuster Video in the middle of a shopping plaza. After a brief communication with Yon-Rogg, learning she will be stranded on Earth for the next 22 hours, she attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. after a night-shift Los Angeles Police Department officer reports her in. Nick Fury and Phil Coulson led by Keller arrives at Los Angeles to interrogate Vers, dismissing her Kree authority and her claims that the Skrulls have arrived on Earth. The interrogation is interrupted by one of the Skrulls. Vers give chase to the Skrull on a subway train, but the Skrull evades her and escapes amid a crowd at a train station. Fury and Coulson give chase to Vers, but Fury realizes that Coulson was actually abandoned at the shopping complex, and the Coulson sitting passenger-side next to him is a second Skrull impostor. The two have a scuffle, and the Skrull is killed when their car crashes into oncoming traffic. Vers utilizes a Skrull crystal containing her lost memories and begins recollecting them. She dresses in a civilian outfit she stole from a display and steals a motorcycle to drive to Pancho's Bar in the nearby town of Rosamond. Fury and Keller, who at this point has been compromised by Talos, take possession of the deceased Skrull and while performing an autopsy, Keller authorizes Fury to work with Vers, and eventually hand her in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Fury finds Vers at the bar, and now fully convinced that the Skrulls are a threat, the two question each other to ensure that they are not Skrull impostors.",

She learns that she was a fighter pilot for the United States Air Force alongside a fellow comrade, Maria Rambeau, both under the tutelage of Wendy Lawson for Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.. Vers recognizes Lawson as the woman murdered in her dreams and later learns from Yon-Rogg that she was a Kree named Mar-Vell. Fury reports to Keller of their location and a posse of agents led by Keller arrive, including Coulson. Upon realizing that Keller had been compromised by Talos the whole time, Fury goes rogue with Vers. Coulson allows the two to escape. Motivated to seek answers from Rambeau, Fury, and Vers, accompanied by Goose, a cat who they encountered at the facility, hijack a Quinjet to the Rambeau Residence in New Orleans, Louisiana. Both Rambeau and her daughter Monica are surprised to see Vers still alive. The two identify Vers as Carol Danvers, a fighter pilot who was seemingly killed with Lawson in a test flight gone awry. They also identify Goose as Lawson and Danvers' pet. Talos and Norex arrive at the Rambeau Residence, only to negotiate a temporary alliance after Talos reveals that he was in possession of a black box from the plane crash. Talos reveals that Danvers has been deceived by the Kree and that the Skrulls are simply homeless refugees constantly on the run from the Kree, on the brink of extinction. Upon hearing the recording from the black box, Danvers finally recollects the memory of what happened. The assassination was orchestrated by none other than Yon-Rogg, who had uncovered Mar-Vell's deception. Mar-Vell instructed Danvers to destroy the energy core powering the light-speed engine, but in an attempt to destroy it, Danvers gained cosmic powers after absorbing the energy from the exploding engine. With no recollection of her memories, Yon-Rogg was authorized by the Supreme Intelligence to train her into becoming a Kree soldier.",

The next day, Yon-Rogg arrives on Earth to confront Danvers. He quickly realizes that the Danvers he was communicating with was Norex, and swiftly executes him upon learning of the laboratory orbiting Earth, and learning that the source of the energy core is the Tesseract. Danvers, Fury, Talos, Maria, and Goose take the Quinjet to the laboratory, and Talos is reunited with his wife and daughter. Danvers finds the Tesseract, but the Starforce ambush them and place Danvers under stasis to confront the Supreme Intelligence. In a final conversation with the Supreme Intelligence, Danvers removes the inhibitor that has been limiting her full power potential and engages in an all-out battle with the Starforce. Fury realizes that Goose is actually a Flerken, and witnesses his abilities firsthand after she swallows the Tesseract and several Kree soldiers echoing an earlier scene where Talos expressed fear of Flerkens and insisted that Goose was not a cat. In a battle for the Tesseract, Danvers overpowers Korath, Bron-Char and Att-Lass while the Skrulls escape on the Quadjet with Rambeau and Fury. In the process, Talos is shot by Yon-Rogg, rendering him inoperable to fight.",

By stimulating the sensors of the brain (and after at least seven operations), Fury's doctors were actually able to bring Coulson back to life days after he had been killed. The process was extremely, inhumanly agonizing for Coulson, who begged the doctors to let him die. During the process, they altered some of his memories to make him believe that he was revived in Tahiti, in order to cope with the pain he felt and to make him less suicidal, as he wanted to die due to the intense agony he was experiencing. in addition his memories of leading Project T.A.H.I.T.I. were also wiped.

Fury and Hill told them that Project Insight was only hours away and that they had to act quickly. The Helicarriers would hover in a triangle, connected, targeting all its targets before firing. The only way to prevent this was to use three special chips that would take away S.H.I.E.L.D.'s control over the Helicarriers. Fury intended to save S.H.I.E.L.D. but Steve firmly insisted that the organization be dismantled after all the corruption it had fallen under. ",

With this information, Coulson has Skye, May, Trip and Hunter go out to intercept Creel and retrieve the Obelisk. Trip is put in a sniper position while the rest are on the ground. Once Trip gets his sights on Creel, Hunter betrays the team and takes them out with his I.C.E.R. Creel's contact helps him get the infection under control, but Hunter fires at them from a close range with Trip's sniper rifle. The contact gets out of the way, while Creel turns his body into iron and the bullet bounces off him. Creel chases Hunter into a store and quickly overpowers him. Just as he is about to kill Hunter, Coulson comes out from behind him and puts the device Fitz and Mack came up on Creel's back, causing Creel to lose control of his powers and turn into stone. ",

Hunter is at first reluctant to go on a mission with his ex-wife, but eventually relents. Morse and Hunter try to be nice towards each other on the way to Okinawa, each trying to break the tension between them by complimenting their looks. Once they get there, the plan is for Agent Morse, who knows Mori from her days working undercover at HYDRA, to deceive him into giving up HYDRA's plans while May and Hunter wait on the plane. She does this by flirting with him, and Mori reveals HYDRA's next target is Julien Beckers, a Belgian foreign minister who spoke against Senator Ward's crusade against S.H.I.E.L.D. While this information is being revealed, Hunter notices a HYDRA agent coming up being Morse and intervenes to stop him. Morse then takes out Mori, and reminds her ex-husband he didn't need to save her. The three of them then take off for Belgium to save Beckers from HYDRA. ",

Coulson recognizes the woman as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but Skye finds that her record says she died five years ago. Coulson and Skye go to New York to investigate the scene, and find that she had made numerous paintings of the carvings before she died. They take the body back to the playground with her, where Simmons discovers she had the GH.325 serum in her blood, meaning she was a test subject in the T.A.H.I.T.I. project. Realizing that the killer must be another T.A.H.I.T.I. test subject, Coulson puts himself in the memory machine to see if he can uncover his identity. The machine takes Coulson back to his days running the T.A.H.I.T.I. project, and forces him to re-witness the deterioration of the test subjects' mental states as they start making the carvings. Coulson solved the problem by having one of the lead scientists on the project implant the test subjects with false memories and give them a new life. As Coulson is reliving these memories, he starts convulsing and shouting how he needs to know about the carvings, forcing the others to take him out of the machine. They've narrowed the identity of the killer down to two former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents - Hank Thompson and Sebastian Derik. Skye privately tells the Director that he needs to stay behind, as his condition is worsening, but Coulson throws her into Ward's cell and leaves on his own. ",

Inside, Ward offers to get Bakshi close enough to Coulson to \"put a bullet in him point blank.\" Hunter lets the other agents on the hunt for him know about the meeting. They regroup in Boston, but once they go into the bar they find Ward killed the bartender and tied up Bakshi. The agents take him into their custody and bring him back to the Playground. Meanwhile, Coulson arrives at the house of Hank Thompson, and demands at gunpoint he reveal anything he knows about the carvings. Thompson tells him he couldn't help either of them as the killer, Sebastian Derik, sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. Derik then ties up Thompson, his family, and Coulson in the Thompson's barn, where Thompson and his son have built an elaborate model train set. Derik tells Coulson that he could bring back his memories by experiencing pain, which is why he was killing the former T.A.H.I.T.I. test subjects. Coulson, meanwhile, realizes Thompson's train set was actually the runes, revealing they are meant to be viewed in three dimensions. As Derik is threatening Coulson with a knife, Thompson manages to cut out of his ties and free his family. Derik realizes his prisoner was escaping and throws his knife at him, but Thompson manages to catch the blade in mid-air and throw it back at him. Derik dives out of the way, but the knife cuts Coulson out of his ties. Derik attacks Coulson while he tries to get his assailant to realize what he has discovered about the carvings. Coulson eventually gets Derik over a railing looking down on the train set, but Derik refuses to open his eyes. Simmons and Skye, who was freed after Simmons realized what Coulson had done arrive on the scene and pull their guns on Coulson and Derik, threatening to shoot both of them as Coulson may have gone crazy like Garrett had. Just as they are about to open fire, Derik opens his eyes and realizes what Coulson had been trying to show him - the carvings aren't as much a map as they are the blueprints to a city. ",

Daisy and Hive confront a reaper each, with Daisy managing to begin harvesting hers' blood until the process is sabotaged by Mack. Hive, not realizing this, destroys the other reaper. Daisy attacks Mack, nearly killing him, but is interrupted by May, who helps Mack retreat with the rest of their team. Daisy then offers her own blood as an alternative for Radcliffe's experiment, as it was recently infused with Kree blood. ",

Ross explains that, due to the events in Lagos, the United Nations has decided they can no longer be allowed to operate privately. To that end, it has been decided that the Avengers will sign the \"Sokovia Accords\", which will establish an international governing body to control the Avengers' movements as well as monitor and police the rapidly growing number of superhumans. The team is divided over the act. Tony supports government oversight because he feels guilty for his role in creating Ultron, whereas Steve worries that the Avengers may be compromised if it comes under the control of a third party after the infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. by HYDRA. Ross states that refusing to sign the accords will be seen as an act of resignation. Elsewhere retired HYDRA general Vasily Karpov is ambushed by Helmut Zemo, who asks for information regarding the 1991 mission. Karpov refuses, forcing Zemo to kill him. During their debate about the Accords, Steve learns that Peggy Carter has passed away in her sleep and leaves for her funeral in London. While there, he learns Sharon Carter was Peggy's niece as she delivers a eulogy about how one should never back down from what they believe in. This solidifies Roger's resolve not to sign the accords. Wanda finds herself confined to the New Avengers Facility by Vision, ostensibly for her safety since feelings are running high after what happened in Lagos. ",

Tess is resurrected by Kasius and sent to relay demands for him, who threatens to detonate explosives killing everyone if they weren't met. Mack and Yo-Yo retaliate by placing the explosives on Level 35, the medical floor, which would prevent Kasius from breeding more inhumans. During a standoff with Kasius, Flint evacuates the inhabitants to the upper levels and uses the remaining explosives to separate them from the lower levels, out of Kasius’ reach. Using the gravity storm to her advantage, May navigates the Zephyr into space as Daisy battles Sinara again, this time killing her. Daisy then contacts Mack while the team are heading for the Lighthouse. Kasius, however, knew this because of his seer. ",

Rhodes suspects Barton is responsible for the deaths of multiple cartel members, which upsets Natasha. Despite his apprehension, Romanoff pleads with Rhodes to continue tracking the rogue Clint. Steve enters the room and the two consul each other, admitting that while they've now devoted their lives to helping others move on from what happened neither of them ever can. The gloomy mood is interrupted when Scott arrives on the compound. While initially skeptical, the two realize that Scott is indeed alive and welcome him into the facility. Upon arrival, he is greeted by Natahsa and Steve, the three begin discussing the means of his survival where Scott explains his own experience in the Quantum Realm and how they might use it to undo the events of the Decimation. The trio, with limited knowledge about the Quantum Realm, then seek out Tony. ",

Despite hoping that he would fail, he discovers the key to it, solving how to navigate the time-travel stream using an inverted Möbius strip model. After having done so, he discusses with Pepper about the morality of time travel and about what he should do with his latest discovery: whether he should lock it up in a box and throw it into the bottom of the lake or not. He feels that he and Pepper were lucky that they were both spared and now have made an amazing life together, but he can't deny that everyone around them has suffered unimaginable horrors and should be helped. Pepper encourages him to do what is right. At the New Avengers Facility, Bruce, Steve, and Natasha run an experiment with time travel by trying to send Lang back in time. It only works to the point that they send Scott's body back in time, turning him into a child, then an old man, and finally a baby before only just managing to restore him to normal. Steve contemplates outside of the building about what to do next. Tony, having a change of heart, shows up then to extend his help and asks if the \"whole team\" are getting back together. Steve tell him they're still working on gathering everyone who's available together. Tony tells Steve that he's agreeing to help on the condition that trying to reverse what Thanos did won't reset what has happened since, as he doesn't want to lose his daughter. Steve agrees that's how it should be. The two men finally put their differences behind them, and Tony returns Rogers' shield to him. ",

Believing himself to be expendable, Clint volunteers for the first time travel test and is transported to a time period on his farm before the Decimation. With disbelief and hope, he calls out to his daughter but is brought back to the present before she sees him. With the test proven a success, the Avengers proceed with the next phase of preparation which is to determine the location of each Infinity Stone in the past. While the team discusses strategy, Rhodes argues the suggestion of travelling back in time to kill 'Baby Thanos' to which Bruce explains that altering events in the past will not alter the present but will instead create an alternate universe leaving the only feasible course of action of acquiring the Infinity Stones to restore everyone in the present time. This presents a challenge as they possess a scarce supply of Pym Particles to operate with and no means of replenishing them without Hank Pym their creator, effectively limiting their travel to a few trips. The team discuss their past encounters with the Infinity Stones, they manage to recall the placement of each Infinity Stone in time. Fortunately, they realize the Time, Space, and Mind Stone were all present in 2012 New York City, in relatively close proximity with each other, following the Battle of New York. However, the other three Stones were only accessible to them in entirely different places and times, with the Reality Stone being present on Asgard in 2013, and the Soul and Power Stones being present in 2014 on Vormir and Morag respectively. Though their supply of Pym Particles allows for one round-trip each, with their targets located, the Avengers split into three separate teams; Thor and Rocket to Asgard, Nebula Rhodes to Morag, Natasha and Clint to Vormir and Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Lang to New York.

Thor insists upon being the one to wield it, claiming to be the strongest, but the others argue that using the gauntlet at full power channels more power than he's capable of safely handling; being reminded how Thanos barely survived using it. Ultimately, it's Bruce, who theorizes that his unique physiology should enable him to safely use the device, being that the majority of the energy being harnessed is gamma radiation. Banner puts the gauntlet on and it causes him intense pain as the energy from the stones surges through him, but eventually, he manages to snap his fingers. Bruce suffers major damage to his right arm and shoulder but believes he was successful in restoring the universe's population. This is proven true when Laura calls Clint on the phone. ",

However, with the Avengers Quantum Tunnel being destroyed along with the Avengers' facility, their alternative is to use the one housed in Luis' van, which is behind enemy lines. The Avengers' forces manage to gain the upper hand, and even restrain Thanos, momentarily until he orders the Sanctuary II to fire upon the battlefield. As artillery fire rains down on both forces, Captain Marvel finally arrives, destroying the Sanctuary II, and pushes back the enemy forces. The Avengers continue to trade possession of the Nano Gauntlet among each other, all the while evading Thanos as they proceed towards the van. Just within reach of their goal, Thanos destroys the Quantum Tunnel device and secures the gauntlet for himself. Strange reminds Stark of their earlier discussion as the Avengers swarm Thanos, who's attempting to activate the Infinity Stones. With the last Avenger defeated, Tony leaps at Thanos and tussles with him before being thrown off. Thanos revels in his supposed victory before snapping his fingers, but nothing happens. Thanos realizes the Infinity Stones are missing, as his attention turns to Tony who is now in possession of the stones in his nanoparticles armor constructing a gauntlet with them. Tony retorts Thanos previous statement, declaring \"i am Iron Man\" before snapping his fingers. Thanos witnesses his entire army turn to dust, and accepts defeat before he himself finally crumbles in the wind. Tony collapses from the wounds he sustained from using the Infinity Stones. After sharing brief and silent goodbyes with Rhodes and Peter, he is comforted by Pepper who assures him she and Morgan will be all right. With this, Tony died, holding her hand as his armor's arc reactor went dead. ",

So, the Eternals were deployed onto Earth to protect the humans, unaware that they were also defending a seed that would spawn the new Celestial Tiamut once the population quota of intelligent life was achieved. When that happens, the Emergence would commence, resulting in the destruction of the planet and the birth of said Celestial, which would allow for new life and galaxies to form. Afterwards, the memories of the Eternals would be taken from them and studied by Arishem to make way for their next planetary mission. Appalled with the true meaning of their existence, Sersi informs the others. Together, they realize that Thena's mental affliction was the result of a botched memory wipe after a previous Emergence.

All the while, Peter is met with an overabundance of stress after Tony Stark's death, juggling with the responsibilities of being Spider-Man. Fury attempts to contact Parker during a charity event as Spider-Man with his Aunt May, but he dismisses it and redirects it to Happy Hogan. Peter's attempts to bond with MJ on the airplane ride to Italy proved futile. Peter's wingman and best friend Ned Leeds becomes infatuated with Betty Brant, and the two announce they are dating when they arrive in Venice.

Peter attempts to stop it to no avail, until the armored Beck arrives, and destroys it after luring it out of the canal. That night, Fury meets Parker in person and introduces him to Beck. Beck explains that the creatures are Elementals from an alternate dimension of Earth, which have emerged to their dimension in the Blip. Beck is determined to defeat them because they killed his family, and reveals that the final Elemental, Fire, is due to make an appearance in Prague. To accommodate Peter's request to keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret without arousing suspicion, Fury rearranges the school trip's location from Paris to Prague, through the trip's chaperones, Roger Harrington and Julius Dell.

Deke reveals that he has secretly been training the members of the band to be S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and that Coulson's consciousness has been saved on a hard drive. Meanwhile, Sybil's consciousness also survived, and she uses a lonely programmer to construct a crude body for herself. She then creates new \"hunter\" robots that kill the programmer before invading the Lighthouse in search of the time stream that Sybil uses to predict the future. Mack helps Deke and the new agents defeat the hunters, but a small robot escapes with the time stream. The Zephyr, re-appears long enough for May and Yo-Yo to reunite with Mack and Deke; the latter recounts the events of the past year to May. The small robot takes the time stream to Nathaniel Malick, who is working with the consciousness of Sybil. ",

He also reveals that he created the TVA after several variants of himself discovered alternative universes and contacted each other in the 31st century.

As the timeline begins to diverge, He Who Remains finds he can no longer anticipate the future and Sylvie tries to kill him. Loki fights her, fearing He Who Remains might be right and pleading that he wants to keep her safe. They kiss, but Sylvie uses the TemPad to send Loki back to the TVA headquarters and kills a surrendering He Who Remains, unleashing a multiverse with timelines that cannot be pruned. ",
